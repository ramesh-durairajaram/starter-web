Nepal's parliament is holding a special session to vote on a constitutional amendment bill, in a move to update the country's map -- which includes a stretch of land high in the mountains that India claims as its own.

The House of Representatives opened the discussion on the amendment bill which will be put for voting after the deliberations are over, news agency PTI quoted spokesman at parliament, Rojnath Pandey, as saying.

He reportedly said the House has been working to put the bill to vote today.

Last month, Nepal's ruling party had cleared the map, drawing fierce reaction from India, which described the move as "unilateral" and not based on historical facts.

The opposition Nepali Congress had said it would vote in favour of the amendment, amid friction with India over the issue.

The new map - made public last month - shows a sliver of land on the east of river Kali, jutting out from the northwestern tip of Nepal. The area includes the Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand and also Limpiyadhura and Kalapani, which are highly strategic areas which India has been guarding since the 1962 war with China.
